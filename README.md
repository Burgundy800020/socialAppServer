## Intro
Server side app of the MathConnect platform.

The MathConnect web app was developped to allow the members of any math club to remotely share problems with each other.

Sign up for an account and follow other users to see the problems they have posted. Write your own math problems (Latex is supported) and share them with your community. 

This app was built using the MERN (MongoDb, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
